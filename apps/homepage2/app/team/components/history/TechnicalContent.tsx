        <strong>Overview of Themes</strong>
        <br />
        Themes are a key feature of JSON Resume that allow users to change the
        appearance of their resume without modifying the underlying data. A
        theme is essentially a template that defines how the resume data is
        displayed. Themes can be simple or complex, depending on the design and
        formatting requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Pre-built Themes</strong>
        <br />
        The JSON Resume project includes several pre-built themes that users can
        apply to their resumes. These themes cover a range of styles, from
        minimalist designs to more elaborate layouts. Users can browse and
        preview these themes on the JSON Resume website or through the CLI.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Creating Custom Themes</strong>
        <br />
        For those with specific design preferences, creating a custom theme is
        an option. Custom themes are created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        The JSON Resume documentation provides guidelines and examples to help
        users develop their own themes. Custom themes can be shared with the
        community by submitting them to the JSON Resume registry.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Theme Marketplace</strong>
        <br />
        There is potential for a theme marketplace where designers can create
        and sell premium themes for JSON Resume. This marketplace would provide
        additional revenue opportunities for designers and offer users a wider
        selection of high-quality themes.

      <h4 id="the-registry">The Registry</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Function and Benefits</strong>
        <br />
        The JSON Resume registry serves as a central repository for publishing
        and sharing resumes. By submitting a resume to the registry, users can
        generate a unique URL for their resume, making it easy to share with
        potential employers. The registry ensures that resumes are always
        up-to-date and accessible.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Security and Privacy</strong>
        <br />
        Security and privacy are important considerations for the registry.
        Users have control over the visibility of their resumes and can choose
        to make them public or private. The registry also implements security
        measures to protect users' data and prevent unauthorized access.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Integration with Job Boards</strong>
        <br />
        Integrating the registry with job boards and applicant tracking systems
        (ATS) could further streamline the job application process. This
        integration would allow job seekers to submit their resumes directly
        from the registry, ensuring that employers receive the most up-to-date
        version of their resume.

      <h4 id="agnostic-nature">Agnostic Nature</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Platform Independence</strong>
        <br />
        JSON Resume's platform-agnostic design means that it can be used across
        different operating systems, devices, and applications. This
        independence ensures that resumes created in JSON format are not tied to
        any specific software or platform, promoting widespread adoption and
        compatibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Interoperability with Other Formats</strong>
        <br />
        While JSON is the primary format used by JSON Resume, the project
        supports interoperability with other formats. Tools and libraries are
        available to convert JSON resumes to formats such as PDF, HTML, and
        Markdown. This interoperability ensures that resumes can be easily
        shared and viewed by anyone, regardless of the tools they use.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>API and Integration Capabilities</strong>
        <br />
        JSON Resume can be integrated with various applications and services
        through APIs. For example, developers can build integrations that
        automatically update a user's resume with new information from LinkedIn
        or GitHub. These integrations enhance the functionality of JSON Resume
        and provide a seamless experience for users.
